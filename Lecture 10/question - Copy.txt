A startup named GreenGo is building an eco-friendly ride-sharing app. The web team is designing a driver registration form in HTML to collect the following information:

Password (must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character)

Age (between 21 and 60)

Vehicle Registration Number (e.g., MH12AB1234 â€” exactly 10 characters)

A note: the Email ID field should be pre-filled and uneditable during form updates.
